# Helsinki Public Transport Network Simulation

There is a ready to run small simulated scenario in `20-node-demo/` directory. See the directory README for more information.

The full Helsinki region dataset is still under work. The main part is ready, but need to find a way to convert `osm` and `GTFO` to a MATSim readable XML file.
Main project scripts are in `scripts/`, config files in `config/` and the data is stored in `data/`, no data is stored on the github so see the `data/` README for more instructions.
